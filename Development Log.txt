							Assignment: Distributed Mobile Application – Fruit Service Engine
							Platform: Java Servlets + RMI + MySQL + HTML (NetBeans IDE)
							Duration: June 24 – July 7, 2025
						===============================================================================
 
1. Project Initialization - 2025-06-24
==========================================================================================================================
Set up a new Java Web application in NetBeans, establishing a clean folder structure (web pages, interfaces, server logic, and servlets).
Integrated com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver and configured GlassFish Server 4.1.1.
Created the fruitdb MySQL database and designed the fruit_price table with fields for name and price.


2. Initial RMI Server and Utility Setup - 2025-06-25
==========================================================================================================================
Implemented key server-side RMI components: Compute, Task, and DatabaseUtility.
Developed server task classes: AddFruitPrice, UpdateFruitPrice, DeleteFruitPrice, CalFruitCost, and CalculateCost.
Deployed and tested FruitComputeEngine to confirm RMI registry startup on port 1099.


3. Development of Client Servlets - 2025-06-26
==========================================================================================================================
Created servlets for handling client-side HTTP requests and forwarding them to RMI services:
AddFruitServlet, CalFruitCostServlet, CalculateCostServlet, DeleteFruitPriceServlet, and UpdateFruitPriceServlet.
Connected servlet actions to RMI task handlers.


4. User Interface and Form Design - 2025-06-27
===========================================================================================================================
Developed HTML forms for the following functions:
-Add Fruit
-Update Fruit Price
-Delete Fruit
-Calculate Fruit Cost
-Generate Receipt
-Conducted display testing and verified UI renders across different browsers.


5. Servlet Logic: Add & Update - 2025-06-28
============================================================================================================================
AddFruitServlet
Connected HTML form to AddFruitPrice RMI task.
Inserted data into the database and validated with success response.
UpdateFruitPriceServlet
Connected update form to UpdateFruitPrice RMI task.
Fixed initial 404 error due to servlet misconfiguration in web.xml.
Validated that fruit price updates reflected in database.


6. Servlet Logic: Delete, Cost Calculations - 2025-06-30
===========================================================================================================================
DeleteFruitPriceServlet
Connected delete form input to DeleteFruitPrice RMI task.
Resolved SQL error by correcting table column reference (fruit_name).
Successfully removed entries and confirmed deletion.
CalFruitCostServlet
Processed fruit cost computation by retrieving form input and invoking CalFruitCost task.
Output calculation returned accurate results during test runs.
CalculateCostServlet
Enabled receipt generation using cashier name, total cost, and payment.
Performed end-to-end transaction simulation with correct change computation.


7. System Integration and Testing - 2025-07-02
=============================================================================================================================
Performed integration testing for all servlets and RMI back-end tasks.
Verified CRUD operations and cost calculations with various input values.
Confirmed MySQL database responses under edge cases.


8. Project Report Writing - 2025-07-04
==============================================================================================================================
Documented key features, design approach, and technical choices.
Included implementation steps, test cases, and screen captures.
Finalized the project submission report document.


9. Log Diary Compilation - 2025-07-05
==============================================================================================================================
Reviewed and compiled daily development logs into this complete development diary.
Ensured accurate date tagging and detailed task breakdown for submission.


10. Final Deployment & GitHub Submission - 2025-07-07
==============================================================================================================================
Uploaded final project version to GitHub.
Validated remote deployment and shared access credentials for project review.
